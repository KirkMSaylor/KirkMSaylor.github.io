Project proposal - brief recap of more detailed proposal previously coordinated with professor

### Topic: Anthropogenic transformation of biomes from 10,000 BC to 2015 AD. 
  - Anthropogenic biome classification scheme will be based on Ellis and Ramankutty (2008, p. 442)

### Data
  - Primary dataset: “Anthromes 12K” dataset based on HYDE v. 3.2. (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017)
  - Ancillary datasets: Potential natural vegetation datasets 

### Transformations or subsets 
  - To be performed using R packages / functions
    (a) diffeR (Pontius 2019) 

### Analyses 
  - Statistical comparison of new Anthromes 12K against previous Anthromes v. 2 to quantify
    relative "goodness of fit"
  - Statistical analysis of Anthromes 12K change over time 
    (a) by biome
    (b) by geographical region

### Outputs
Tables and graphs of change across space over time after Ellis et al. (2010)
